Random Forest Classification with Python and Scikit-Learn


Random Forest is a supervised machine learning algorithm which is based on ensemble learning. In this project, I build two Random Forest Classifier models to predict the safety of the car, one with 10 decision-trees and another one with 100 decision-trees. The expected accuracy increases with number of decision-trees in the model. I have demonstrated the **feature selection process** using the Random Forest model to find only the important features, rebuild the model using these features and see its effect on accuracy. I have used the **Car Evaluation Data Set** for this project, downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository website.
